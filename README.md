🩺 RAG4HealthQA – Healthcare Q&A Assistant
RAG4HealthQA is an AI-powered healthcare assistant that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide trustworthy, explainable answers to health-related questions. Built with LangChain, FAISS, Cohere LLMs, and a curated public health knowledge base (WHO, NIH, CDC), it supports digital health education, public outreach, and personalized learning.

🔍 Live demo powered by Streamlit + FAISS + LangChain + Cohere
