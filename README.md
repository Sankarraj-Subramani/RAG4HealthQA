##🩺 RAG4HealthQA – Healthcare Q&A Assistant
RAG4HealthQA is an AI-powered healthcare assistant that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide trustworthy, explainable answers to health-related questions. Built with LangChain, FAISS, Cohere LLMs, and a curated public health knowledge base (WHO, NIH, CDC), it supports digital health education, public outreach, and personalized learning.

## Live demo powered by Streamlit + FAISS + LangChain + Cohere
- Knowledge grounded in official medical content
- Designed to serve public interest — EB2-NIW ready

## Features
- ** RAG-based architecture with real-time retrieva
- ** Clean UI using Streamlit for patient-friendly Q&A
- ** Uses FAISS (no SQLite issues) for efficient local vector search
- ** Knowledge base sourced from WHO, NIH, Nutrition.gov
- ** Dynamically refreshable .md/.txt content for new updates
- ** Modular backend (retriever, embedder, LLM, pipeline)
## Example Questions
- What are the symptoms of hypertension?
- How does CBT help with PTSD?
- Is vegetarian diet safe for athletes?
- How much water should adults drink daily?
