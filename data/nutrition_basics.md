## Nutrition Basics â€“ U.S. Department of Agriculture

Good nutrition is essential for maintaining a healthy body and mind. The USDA provides guidance on building a balanced diet using MyPlate, which includes:

- **Fruits and Vegetables**: Aim to fill half your plate with a variety of fruits and vegetables.
- **Grains**: Choose whole grains such as brown rice, oats, and whole wheat bread.
- **Proteins**: Include lean meat, poultry, seafood, beans, nuts, and seeds.
- **Dairy**: Opt for low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese.

### Eating for Exercise and Sports
Nutrient timing and hydration play key roles in athletic performance. Carbohydrates support endurance, while proteins help with muscle repair.

### Vegetarian and Plant-Based Eating
It is possible to meet all your nutrient needs with a vegetarian diet. Focus on plant-based protein sources and ensure adequate intake of iron, calcium, and vitamin B12.

### Hydration and Water Needs
Water is crucial for digestion, nutrient transport, and temperature regulation. General recommendations suggest 2.7 liters/day for women and 3.7 liters/day for men, including all fluids and water-rich foods.

### Resources and Tools
- **MyPlate Tracker**: Helps monitor food intake and activity
- **BMI Calculator**: Estimates body weight status
- **Printable Handouts**: Great for education and public health outreach
