## Hypertension – WHO Fact Sheet

### Key Facts
- Over 1.28 billion adults aged 30–79 have hypertension globally; two-thirds live in low- and middle-income countries.
- 46% of adults with hypertension are unaware they have it.
- Only 21% have it under control.
- A major cause of premature death, hypertension is targeted for a 33% reduction by 2030.

### What is Hypertension?
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, occurs when the force of blood against artery walls is consistently too high — typically ≥140/90 mmHg. Often asymptomatic, it can only be detected through measurement.

### Risk Factors

#### Modifiable
- High-salt diet
- Physical inactivity
- Excess alcohol or tobacco
- Obesity
- Air pollution

#### Non-modifiable
- Age > 65
- Family history
- Comorbidities like diabetes or kidney disease

### Symptoms
Often silent, but very high BP can cause:
- Headaches
- Chest pain
- Dizziness
- Visual changes
- Shortness of breath
- Irregular heartbeats

### Diagnosis
Hypertension is diagnosed if systolic BP ≥140 and/or diastolic BP ≥90 on two different days.

### Treatment
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Reduce salt, eat more fruits/vegetables, quit smoking, exercise more
- **Medications**: May include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, diuretics

### Prevention Tips
✅ Eat more vegetables and fruits  
✅ Exercise ≥150 minutes per week  
✅ Lose weight if overweight  
✅ Take prescribed medications  
❌ Avoid high salt, saturated fats  
❌ Avoid alcohol abuse and tobacco  

### Complications
If untreated, hypertension may cause:
- Stroke
- Heart attack
- Heart failure
- Kidney damage
- Vision loss

### Global Impact
- WHO African Region has highest prevalence (27%)
- Americas have lowest (18%)
- WHO launched the Global Hearts Initiative with CDC to support country-level interventions
