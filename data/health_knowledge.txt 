Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of the blood against artery walls is too high. It is considered a silent killer because it often has no warning signs or symptoms. Managing blood pressure involves lifestyle modifications such as a low-sodium diet, regular physical activity, limiting alcohol, and stress management.

Vaccinations are a key component of preventive healthcare. Immunizations protect individuals and communities by preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as measles, influenza, and hepatitis. Herd immunity is achieved when a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, reducing the chances of disease outbreaks.
