## Diabetes – MedlinePlus (NIH/NLM)

Diabetes, also called diabetes mellitus, is a chronic disease in which blood glucose (sugar) levels are too high. Glucose is the main energy source for the body and comes from both food and internal production. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose enter cells. In diabetes, the body either doesn't produce insulin, doesn't use it effectively, or both.

### Types of Diabetes

- **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune condition where the body destroys insulin-producing cells. It typically begins in childhood or adolescence.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: The most common form. The body produces insulin but cells don’t respond well to it (insulin resistance). Often associated with obesity and inactivity.
- **Gestational Diabetes**: Develops during pregnancy. Hormonal changes can impair insulin function.

### Causes

- **Type 1**: Autoimmune, genetic, and possible environmental triggers
- **Type 2**: Genetic + lifestyle (e.g., obesity, inactivity)
- **Gestational**: Pregnancy-related hormonal changes + predisposing factors

### Risk Factors

- Being overweight or obese
- Age > 35 (especially for Type 2)
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Family history of diabetes
- Gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy
- Birth to a baby > 9 lbs
- Ethnic groups: African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Asian American, Pacific Islander
- High blood pressure or PCOS

### Symptoms

- Excessive thirst and hunger
- Frequent urination
- Blurry vision
- Fatigue
- Tingling or numbness in feet/hands
- Sores that don’t heal
- Unexplained weight loss
- Gestational diabetes may show no symptoms

### Diagnosis

Diagnosis involves blood tests like:
- **A1C test**
- **Fasting glucose test**
- **Oral glucose tolerance test**

### Treatment

- **Type 1**: Requires daily insulin. Some may use pumps or injections, along with glucose monitoring.
- **Type 2**: Often managed with diet, exercise, and weight loss. Medications or insulin may be needed.
- **Gestational**: Managed via diet and exercise; some may require insulin.

Monitoring blood glucose is essential for all types. Treatment plans vary based on individual health needs and comorbidities.

### Prevention

- **Type 1**: Cannot be prevented
- **Type 2 and Gestational**: May be prevented or delayed with:
  - Healthy eating
  - Maintaining a healthy weight
  - Regular physical activity
